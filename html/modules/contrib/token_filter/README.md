## Usage/Requirements

Install the module as any other module. Visit the text format administration
page at /admin/config/content/formats/filters and edit a text format. Check the
'Replaces global tokens with their value' filter and save the text format.

When editing a form where this text format is used in a field, you can type
global tokens that will be replaced when the filed is rendered.

Additionally, if the [Token](https://drupal.org/project/token) module is enabled,
the token browser is available. You can pick-up the desired token from the
browser by clicking 'Browse available tokens'.
